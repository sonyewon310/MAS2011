# MAS2011
20191106 손예원 Project 1. 

This file is about 4 different pygame codes for my MAS2011 class project1, including the explanation about the code and tutorials. 
This may help you understand the logic of my codes and the intention and the story behind.

1. A clock
This is a clock set by the actual time in Seoul, Korea.
There is an hour needle, a minute needle, and a second needle.
Also, a bell sound rings at every hour, when the minute and the second become 0.
About the ringing bell sound, check the asset/ringing_sound.wav file. 

3. A solar system
This is a solar system that has a sun in the middle and two different planets rotating the sun.
They are also self-rotating. One of the planets, the blue one, has a moon that rotates it.
Another planet, with a random color, has two moons, and one of the moons has another small moon rotating it.
Another point of this pygame code is a wandering spaceship with a green color just like a typical color when we think of an alien.

5. A robot arm system
This is a robot arm system with three arm parts and a gripper, each part connected by joints.
When you press several keyboard buttons, you can move each part of the arm system.
I could not make it perfect, but I tried to make it work as I imagined. 
 
7. Own creation (a windmill)
This is a windmill with 5 different colors in every fans.
For my own creation project, I wanted to use Tmat and Rmat module and make something move continuously.
So, I made a rotating windmill with dynamic colors. The center part has a white circle, and the overlapping parts of the fan looks like a flower.
